# 🤖 Why This Matters: AI as a Bridge, Not a Wall

### 🧠 A Human-First Safety Tool for an Increasing Threat

Every day, scammers are getting faster, sneakier, and more convincing — and now they’ve got help: **AI**.  

From fake delivery texts to voice clones, **bad actors are using AI to scale their attacks** like never before.

\> “AI will accelerate scammers and bad actors. It’s like giving them steroids.”

With AI, scammers can:

- 🚀 Send **more** messages, faster  

- 🎯 Personalize scams to feel more real  

- 🎭 Fool even savvy users with voice and video fakes  

If we don’t equip everyday people with smarter tools, **we’re leaving the front door wide open.**

\> 💸 Over **\$1 trillion** is lost to scams globally every year  

\> 🙅‍♀️ Only **46%** globally trust AI  

\> 😬 Over **70%** don’t trust companies to use AI responsibly

AI is in the news constantly — but most headlines focus on fear.  

“AI is coming for your job” dominates the conversation.  

But for most people, **AI hasn’t helped them personally yet** — it’s felt distant or intimidating.

That’s why SketchyOrNot matters:  

We show how **AI can actually support and protect real people** — in simple, everyday ways.

### 🌉 Why “AI as a Bridge” Matters

Most people already use AI passively — Siri, autocomplete, Netflix — but not to protect themselves.

SketchyOrNot helps you:

- Use AI **intentionally**, not just passively  

- Learn while doing  

- **Build scam-spotting muscle** over time 💪

We believe:

- 💡 AI should make you **more confident**, not more dependent  

- 🫶 Safety should feel **human**, not robotic  

- 🙋 Everyone deserves tools that **don’t talk down to them**

SketchyOrNot is **AI as a bridge** —  

From _“Is this sketchy?”_ to _“I’ve got this.”_
