## 🔭 Our Vision

To help everyday people feel safer, smarter, and more confident when dealing with online messages, links, and scams — without feeling silly, overwhelmed, or alone.

We believe digital safety should be:

- ✅ Easy
- 🆓 Free
- 🫶 Human-first

And most of all — a habit anyone can build.

You don’t need to be “tech-savvy” to stay safe.

You don’t need to feel embarrassed to double check.

We built SketchyOrNot so you don’t have to guess — or go it alone.

## 🌱 Why I Built This

I built this because I live it. And I know I'm not the only one.

Every day, I’m reminding my mum not to click sketchy Facebook links.

I’m helping my dad decide whether an email attachment is safe.

I’m warning my niece about TikTok product offers that seem too good to be true.

Let’s not forget all the courier scams, fake meeting invites, or game downloads that just show up.

So I built something simple.

Because we already say it — _“Is this sketchy or not?”_

So I made it a website — with that exact name:

[**SketchyOrNot.com**](http://SketchyOrNot.com) —

- Easy to remember
- Super simple to use
- And easy to share

Let’s make it a habit.

_Let’s Sketchy or Not it — before we click._

## 🧭 Our Values

### 💬 Human First

We’re not here to impress tech experts.

We’re here to help your mum, your niece, your neighbour, your friends.

### 🛠 Friction-Free Safety

No logins. No paywalls. No judgment.

Just a fast way to double check what feels off — anytime.

### 🧠 Empower, Don’t Scare

We don’t say “This is safe” or “This is dangerous.”

We highlight what might be sketchy so you can decide for yourself — and build your scam-spotting muscle.

### 🤝 Built to Share

It’s meant to be shared.

The more people you share it with, the more people you protect.

### 🧬 Always Evolving

We’re just getting started.

Sketchy or Not will grow — with smarter AI, more upload options, and better tools to help everyone stay safe.

## 🌍 Why This Matters: AI as a Bridge, Not a Wall

If we don’t make tools like this **easy and accessible for everyday people**, we’re leaving the door wide open.

Bad actors are already using AI to their advantage — scaling faster, reaching further, and making scams harder to spot.

Meanwhile, most everyday users are left without tools that feel approachable, trustworthy, or usable.

\> "AI will accelerate scammers and bad actors. It’s like giving them steroids."

SketchyOrNot is built to close that gap — to be the bridge. Not a wall.

AI is in the news constantly — but most headlines focus on fear.

“AI will take your job” dominates the conversation.

But for most people, AI hasn’t helped them personally yet. It’s felt distant or overwhelming.

That’s why we built SketchyOrNot — a human-first tool using AI to actually help in everyday moments, without fear or friction. For all ages\!

## 👥 Meeting People Where They Are

Here’s the truth: If a tool is hard to use, people won’t come back.

\> ⚠️ **88% of users won’t return after a bad experience** (Google/SOASTA)

\> 🔁 **79% leave a site if it’s confusing** (HubSpot)

So we built SketchyOrNot to be:

- ✅ Easy to use
- 🧠 Easy to understand
- 📤 Easy to share

No login. No tech jargon. Not flashy. 

Just support — when you need it most.

SketchyOrNot isn’t just a checker, it's a habit tool to keep you safer — it’s a **scam-spotting muscle builder.**

The more you use it, the smarter and more confident you get.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

SketchyOrNot is just getting started.

My hope is that it becomes a trusted tool you use whenever something feels off — and a way to learn along the way.

We aim to:

- 🏫 Partner with schools, senior centres, and community orgs
- 🤝 Collaborate with digital safety leaders
- 🧰 Build tools that support not just individuals, but families and communities

Because staying safe online shouldn’t be hard.

It should be a habit we all help each other build.
