# 🔭 Our Vision & Values

To help everyday people feel safer, smarter, and more confident when dealing with online messages, links, and scams — without feeling silly, overwhelmed, or alone.

We believe digital safety should be:

- Easy
- Free
- Human-first

And most of all — **a habit anyone can build.**

You don’t need to be “tech-savvy” to stay safe.

You don’t need to feel embarrassed to **double check**.

We built Sketchy or Not so you don’t have to guess — or go it alone.

## 🌱 Why I Built This

I built this because I live it.

Every day, I’m reminding my mum not to click links she gets.

I’m helping my dad figure out whether an email attachment is legit.

I’m warning my niece about TikTok product offers that seem too good to be true.

And let’s not forget all the courier links for mystery packages…

Or the suspicious unsolicited links that invite you to meetings, game downloads, etc. 

---

That’s why I made **Sketchy or Not**.

Because we already say it —

**“Is this sketchy or not?”**

So I made it a website.

A name that’s easy to remember,

even easier to use,

and super simple to share.

Let’s make it a habit.

Let’s _Sketchy or Not_ it — before we click.

## 🧭 Our Values

### 💬 Human First

We’re not here to impress tech experts.

We’re here to help your mum, your niece, your neighbour, your friends.

---

### 🛠 Friction-Free Safety

No logins. No paywalls. No judgment.

Just a fast way to double check what feels off — anytime.

---

### 🧠 Empower, Don’t Scare

We don’t say “This is safe” or “This is dangerous.”

We highlight red flags so you can **build your scam-spotting muscle.**

---

### 🤝 Built to Share

It’s meant to be shared.

The more people you share it with, the more people you protect.

---

### 🧬 Always Evolving

We’re just getting started.

Sketchy or Not will grow — with smarter AI, more upload options, and easier tools to help _everyone_ stay safe.

---

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

As SketchyOrNot grows, our mission goes beyond just one website.

We hope to:

- Partner with **schools**, **senior centres**, and **community groups**
- Collaborate with **digital safety leaders** and **coalitions**
- Build tools that support not just individuals — but **entire families and communities**

Because staying safe online shouldn’t be hard.

It should be a habit we _all_ help each other build.
