# 🔭 Our Vision

To help everyday people feel safer, smarter, and more confident when dealing with online messages, links, and scams — without feeling silly, overwhelmed, or alone.

We believe digital safety should be:

- Easy  

- Free  

- Human-first  

And most of all — **a habit anyone can build.**

You don’t need to be “tech-savvy” to stay safe.  

You don’t need to feel embarrassed to double check.  

We built Sketchy or Not so you don’t have to guess — or go it alone.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

As SketchyOrNot grows, our mission goes beyond just one website.  

We hope to:

- Partner with **schools**, **senior centres**, and **community groups**  

- Collaborate with **digital safety leaders and coalitions**  

- Build tools that support not just individuals — but **entire families and communities**

Because staying safe online shouldn’t be hard —  

It should be a habit we _all_ help each other build.
