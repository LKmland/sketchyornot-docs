## 💬 What is [SketchyOrNot.com](http://SketchyOrNot.com)?

[**SketchyOrNot.com**](http://SketchyOrNot.com) is a free, browser-based safety check tool for everyday life — and it’s easy to remember.

It’s your go-to whenever something feels off — a weird DM, a fake delivery text, a suspicious login page, or even a sketchy crypto message. We already say “is this sketchy or not?” in real life — now you’ve got a simple, trusted tool to help you check before you click.

---

## 🧠 Built for everyone. No tech skills needed.

Whether you’re a teen, a busy parent, a gig worker, or someone just trying to stay safe online — this is for you.

There’s no login, no downloads, and no judgment.

---

## 🎯 What’s the mission?

Our mission is to help you build a **habit** — like putting on your seatbelt before you drive. Each time you use [**SketchyOrNot.com**](http://SketchyOrNot.com), you strengthen your scam-spotting muscle. One quick check at a time.

---

## 🔍 What should I paste into the box?

You can paste any suspicious message, link, or email _text_. If you’re not sure, paste it anyway — even a partial message helps the tool identify red flags.

For now, the tool only works with **text**. Screenshot upload is coming soon.

---

## 🖼️ Can I upload a screenshot?

**Not yet.** That feature is coming soon\! Right now, we only support text-based messages. If you want to stay in the loop, join our email list at the bottom of the site.

---

## 🔒 Is my info private?

Yes. We never collect names or emails unless you choose to enter one for updates. Nothing is stored unless you agree to it. We don’t make “safe or unsafe” claims — we just show you **potential red flags** so you can decide.

---

## 🤖 What’s SketchyMate?

**SketchyMate** is our friendly AI assistant. If you're stuck, confused, or need help using the site, just ask\!

SketchyMate lives in the chat bubble and can answer questions, show you where to click, or help you understand the results. It's powered by AI, not a real human (yet\!).

---

## 🧪 Is this free forever?

That’s the plan. SketchyOrNot is built to help everyday people. It’s funded by optional tips and a few small grants. If you like it, share it or chip in to keep it going\!
