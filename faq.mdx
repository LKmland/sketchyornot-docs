### ❤️ A Note from the Founder: Why This Matters

I made SketchyOrNot because someone I love almost fell for a scam.

It wasn’t because they were careless. It was because scammers are getting good — and most tools out there feel cold, confusing, or built for tech experts.

This one’s different. It’s built for real people. It’s here to help you pause for a second, check that weird message, and feel a little safer doing everyday things.

If this helps one person stop and think before clicking — that’s a win.

### 💬 What is [SketchyOrNot.com](http://SketchyOrNot.com)?

[**SketchyOrNot.com**](http://SketchyOrNot.com) is a free, browser-based safety check tool for everyday life — and it’s easy to remember.

It’s your go-to whenever something feels off — a weird DM, a fake delivery text, a suspicious login page, or even a sketchy crypto message. We already say “is this sketchy or not?” in real life — now you’ve got a simple, trusted tool to help you check before you click.

---

### 🧠 Built for everyone. No tech skills needed.

Whether you’re a teen, a busy parent, a gig worker, or someone just trying to stay safe online — this is for you.

There’s no login, no downloads, and no pressure.

---

### 🎯 What’s the mission?

Our mission is to help you build a **habit** — like putting on your seatbelt before you drive.  

Each time you use [**SketchyOrNot.com**](http://SketchyOrNot.com), you strengthen your scam-spotting muscle. One quick check at a time.

---

### 🔍 What should I paste into the box?

You can paste any suspicious message, link, or email text. If you’re not sure, paste it anyway — even a partial message helps the tool identify red flags.

For now, the tool only works with **text**. Screenshot upload is coming soon.

---

### 🖼️ Can I upload a screenshot?

**Yes — and we made it easy on purpose.** Some people find it hard to copy and paste, especially on a phone. Others just prefer to snap a photo. That’s why we added a simple upload form.

You can **[upload a screenshot or photo here](**[**https://tally.so/r/3X6QpV)**](https://tally.so/r/3X6QpV\)**) and we’ll run it through our AI tools, then send you back a manual review. It’s not instant, but it’s quick — and definitely better than guessing.

And just so you know: **this upload form isn’t going anywhere.** It’s here to stay.  

SketchyOrNot is built to be as **accessible and human-friendly as possible** — for all ages, tech comfort levels, and devices.

🚧 **In addition**, we’re also building a **more seamless screenshot upload feature** — one that’s fully built into the site, smooth, secure, and instant. You’ll be able to upload directly and get AI results right on the page — no waiting, no forms.

---

### 🔐 Is my info private?

Yes. We never collect names or emails unless you choose to enter one for updates.  

Nothing is stored unless you agree to it.

We don’t make “safe or unsafe” claims — we just show you **potential red flags** so you can decide.

### 🤖 What’s SketchyMate?

**SketchyMate** is our friendly AI assistant. If you’re stuck, unsure, or just curious about how the site works, you can ask for help.

SketchyMate lives in the chat bubble and can answer questions, guide you through the process, or help you understand what the AI noticed. It’s powered by AI — not a real human (yet\!).

### 🖊️ Is this free forever?

That’s the plan. **SketchyOrNot** is built to help everyday people. It’s funded by optional tips and a few small grants.
