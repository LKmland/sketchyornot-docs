### ❤️ A Note from the Founder: Why This Matters

I made SketchyOrNot because someone I love almost fell for a scam.

It wasn’t because they were careless. It was because scammers are getting good — and most tools out there feel cold, confusing, or built for tech experts.

This one’s different. It’s built for real people. It’s here to help you pause for a second, check that weird message, and feel a little safer doing everyday things.

If this helps one person stop and think before clicking — that’s a win.
